# School time table management system

## The motivation

Schools near my area manually set the time table for all classes and the teachers. It usually takes them nearly a month to set the time table for the classes, teachers, resolve any conflicts in the time, setup and keep track of all the available slots. This is a tiring work that can be solved and made efficients by the coding.<br />

## The Goal

The main goal is to build a MERN stack application that can automate the time table setup for any school. The aim is to build a free, open source and generalize solutions to the time table management problem.
